## Product Manager
- Love people, product, processes, business development, data & UX. 
- Larning python and refreshing my stats to be more data minded.

## Musician
- Iâ€™m a musician who produces music using guitars and Ableton Live.
- Find me on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/mattabbo) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/71EVcsc1GgSZiEA6cjoK2a).

## Human
- Yoga, meditation, swimming and nature keep me grounded.
- Podcasts, books and travelling is how I learn.

## Learner
- Journalling and hosting meetups allows me to explore my thoughts.
- Inequality, decentralisation, undiagnosed pain are some of the things that keep me up at night.
